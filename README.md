# RecommenderSystem - 

We have implemented three different recommenders for Non personal recommendation.

1. Damped mean recommender system : The recommendation based on the ratings. This is part of Aggregated opininon recommender.The data set is movie dataset for which the damped mean recommendation is peformed to provide mean ratings.


2.Naive Bayes implementation: Recommendation based on the co-occurance. The rating is arrived at based on the affiniti score between the users who have watched the movies.


3.Apriori for Association rules generation based on stores dataset.The rating is arrived at based on the derivation of the association rules. The concepts such as Lift,Confidence and Support will be computed for each of the associations.
